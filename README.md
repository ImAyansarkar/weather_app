# weather_app

Hello Everyone!
This is a small project completely based on front-end. 
This is a weather forecast website which is basically built for to show the updates regarding weather for the searched cities . 
Note that it would only forecast cities within India not outside the boundary , also I used an api openweather , which is completely free to use for fetching data and
visible in our website . 

the languages which I used in this project is : 
html , css , javascript and a little bit of jquerry & bootstrap 

this is an opensource project , if anybody would like to contribute any upgradation or want to edit anything in this , feel free to do it . 

Thanking You!
